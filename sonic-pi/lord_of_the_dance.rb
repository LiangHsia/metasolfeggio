# Lord of the Dance
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhs9ZNH9dHE
#

# I danced in the morning
# when the world was begun
#
# I danced in the Moon
# and the Stars and the Sun
#
#
# And I came down from Heaven
# and I danced on Earth
#
# At Bethlehem I had my birth
#
#
# Dance then,
# wherever you may be,
#
# I am the Lord
# of the Dance, said He!
#
#
# And I'll lead you all
# wherever you may be,
# 
# and I'll lead you all
# in the Dance, said He!
