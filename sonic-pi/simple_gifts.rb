# 'Tis a gift to come down

# Where we ought to be;

# And when we find ourselves

# In the place just right,

# 'Twill be in the value

# Of love and delight

# When true simplicity is gained,

# To bow and to bend

# We shan't be ashamed;

# To turn, turn will be our delight

# Till by turning, turning

# We come 'round right.
