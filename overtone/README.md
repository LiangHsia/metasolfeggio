### Workflow
* in a terminal: `lein repl`
* in emacs: `M-x cider-connect` (or directly `M-x cider-jack-in` to implicitly `lein repl` too)
* in emacs: `C-x C-e` to evaluate an expression. I usually evaluate
  the namespace header, then each expression in turn. Playing music is
  usually encloded in `comment` but you can still evaluate each
  expression within a comment to play.
